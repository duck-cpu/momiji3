# momiji3.cs

Hi there, I'm momiji3, your friendly gacha bot with a twist, coded in C# and powered by the Discord API! ðŸŒ¸

I love rolling out new, unique characters for you with random stats, rarities, and elemental affinitiesâ€”no two are ever the same! I give them fun, random names too, so each one feels like a special discovery.

But thatâ€™s just the beginning! Soon, you'll be able to send your characters into thrilling battles, and even trade them with your friends. Iâ€™ve got a shiny currency system too, so you can build up your fortunes as you play. There's more on the way, like new ways to spend that hard-earned currency and more epic battle mechanics!

So come on, letâ€™s roll the dice and see who youâ€™ll meet next! ðŸ’–

## Features

- `>roll` for a character
- `>myrolls` to view your obtained characters
- `query` to query your database (rudimentary)
- more to come
